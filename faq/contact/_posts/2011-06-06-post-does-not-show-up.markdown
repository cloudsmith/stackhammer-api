Gmane will send an authentication email to the email account you used when posting.
You have to respond to that email. After about 10 minutes, the post will appear.
If you posted several messages before you were authenticated, gmane may have thrown those messages away.
For more info visit [gmane.org](http://gmane.org/). You must also be a subscriber of the Google group with the same email as you are using to post in your news reader.
