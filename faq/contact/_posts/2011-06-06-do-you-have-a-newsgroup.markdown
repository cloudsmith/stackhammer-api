Yes, the [Puppet Geppetto Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/puppet-geppetto?hl=en) is
bidirectionally mirrored to a [Puppet News Group](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.puppet.geppetto)
(via gmane). You can post to the group via your news reader if you have subscribed to the Google group.
